# FreeCodeCamp Certification. Front End Development Libraries

This is a bundle of all projects needed for the Front End Development Libraries Certificate. 

I decided to make all of them in just one single WebSite, doing this to practice a little of React. To be honest, I didn't do all of it just myself, I used Chatgpt, but the code that GPT has done I read it and tried understood it with no problem ! ðŸ™‚. Always giving the the best instructions for the simplest solution.

### Calculator
Here I made 2 versions of the calculator, the one that fCC was asking to do (too buggy), and the "simple" one, where the number is updated after every operation simbol.
